# Notes
This extension creates .ics files (calendar files) that are supposedly compatible with most calendar applications.
I have only tested it so far on google calendar and the iCalendar (Mac application) and it seems to work fine on that.
I have not really tested it much on windows (7,8, or 10), so I don't know how to add this to the calendar applications
that are on those or any other 3rd party calendar applications that are available.

How to get this running:
- If you're reading this, the folder it's in is probably unzipped, that's good
- Open google chrome, and in chrome, go to Settings > Extensions
- On the top bar of this page there will be a box for "Developer mode", check it
- Click on "Load unpacked extension", navigate to the directory that contains the folder this was in and select that
- Go to zed and navigate to "My Schedule", you'll see the icon for this in the address bar

Known problems:
- This does not work properly for overnight shifts, I'm currently working on fixing that
- I have not considered how it would handle a week where the year would change


If you encounter any other problems/errors let me know!
